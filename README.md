## Smart Farm

Demonstration of IoT for Smart farming using Arduino,  and android mobile phone
It shows how to control farming the environment , tasks and processes;
      - Irrigation system
      - Temperature and humidity
      - Lighting 
      - 
	  
This project is one of the submissions for the Mobile First Hackathon 

##How it works

Arduino is connected to censors that measure, lighting, soil moisture, temperature and humidity and output controllers like servos and funs to control the firming environment and perform tasks or processes. e.g control temperature of the smart farm or irrigate the crops based on soil moisture content or increase airflow circulation

Farm operator views feedback from sensors and triggers appropriate actions using his/her android phone
Auto mode setting is also available
